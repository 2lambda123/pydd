# Scripts

Use these to assess various observational prospects for dark dresses:

- Detectability: when can a dark dress' waveform be distinguished from noise?
- Discoverability: how different do dark dress and GR-in-vacuum waveforms look?
- Measurability: how well could a dark dress' parameters be measured?

The scripts `fit_fb.py` and `plot_fb.py` are for calibrating and checking our
`f_b` scaling relation using
[`HaloFeedback`](https://github.com/bradkav/HaloFeedback) runs.
